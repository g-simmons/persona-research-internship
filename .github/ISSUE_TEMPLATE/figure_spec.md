## Variable Types (Reference)
<details><summary>Variable Types (Reference)</summary>
    - *real number*: These are numbers that can be represented on a continuous scale, like weight in kilograms or height in meters.
    - *integer*: These are numbers that can be represented on a discrete scale, like the number of classes you are enrolled in or the number of siblings you have.
    - *categorical*: These are variables that take on a finite set of values, like the type of college you are in or the color of your eyes.
