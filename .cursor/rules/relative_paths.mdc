#Use paths relative to script location, not cwd

description: Use paths relative to the script location, not the current working directory. This makes the code more portable and easier to reason about. If you see absolute paths, change them to paths relative to the script location.

Examples:
```python
import pathlib
script_path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent
file_path = script_path / 'file.txt'
print(file_path)
```
