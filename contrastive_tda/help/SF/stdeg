`FUNCTION:  stdeg - degree with respect to the standard grading`,
`   `,
`CALLING SEQUENCE:  stdeg(f);  stdeg(f,B);`,
`   `,
`PARAMETERS:  f = a symmetric function`,
`             B = (optional) a name`,
`   `,
`SYNOPSIS:`,
`  The standard grading of the ring of symmetric functions assigns the`,
`  degrees 1,2,... to each variable of the form b1,b2,..., and degree n`,
`  to each variable of the form b[mu] with mu a partition of n.`,
`   `,
`  Given a symmetric function f, stdeg(f) returns the degree of f in the`,
`  standard grading. Any variables appearing f that do not belong to a`,
`  basis known to SF (as specified by the global variable ``SF/Bases``) are`,
`  assigned the degree 0.`,
`   `,
`  If B is a name of type 'string', then stdeg(f,B) computes the degree of`,
`  f under the assumption that f is expressed entirely in terms of the`,
`  variables B1,B2,...; (i.e., all other variables are given degree 0).`,
`  Given a name B[] of type 'indexed', stdeg(f,B[]) computes the degree of`,
`  f under the assumption that f is expressed entirely in terms of the`,
`  variables B[mu], where mu ranges over partitions.`,
`   `,
`  Note that stdeg acts as a front-end to Maple's degree function, and`,
`  so inherits all of its peculiarities. In particular, (1) reliable results`,
`  cannot be obtained unless f is expanded or collected with respect to the`,
`  variables of some basis (e.g., (1+p1)^2 - p1^2 and s[2]-h2 are reported`,
`  to have degree 2), and (2) versions of Maple prior to V.5 report that 0`,
`  has degree 0, while current versions report -infinity.`,
`   `,
`  There are no restrictions on basis names of indexed type, but basis names`,
`  of string type must consist of a single letter.`,
`   `,
`EXAMPLES:`,
`  stdeg(s[4,2]*p2-h6);                    yields           8`,
`  stdeg(s[4,2]*p2-h6,s[]);                yields           6`,
`  stdeg(t*p3^3+p4^2,p);                   yields           9`,
