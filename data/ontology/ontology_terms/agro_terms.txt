infer input from direct reg
enabling an MF enables its parts
involved in BP
From ligand activity to has_ligand
inferring direct reg edge from input to regulatory subfunction
inferring direct neg reg edge from input to regulatory subfunction
inferring direct positive reg edge from input to regulatory subfunction
From has_ligand to ligand activity
effector input is compound function input
Input of effector is input of its parent MF
if effector directly negatively regulates X,  its parent MF directly negatively regulates X
